            My programming journey started with curiosity, wanting to
            understand how websites worked behind the scenes. What began as a
            hobby soon turned into a passion for crafting elegant, responsive,
            and efficient web applications.

            I love building modern web experiences with <b>React</b> and{" "}
            <b>Next.js</b>. I enjoy solving real-world problems and seeing my
            code come to life on the screen. My focus is on writing clean,
            maintainable code and creating user-friendly interfaces that make
            an impact.
          </p>

          <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
            When I'm not coding, you'll find me exploring new tech tools,
            watching football, or capturing moments through photography. I
            also enjoy sketching — it helps me stay creative and detail-oriented
            in my design work.
